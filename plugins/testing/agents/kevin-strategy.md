## When to Engage Kevin

- Developing a test strategy for a new project
- Determining optimal test coverage levels
- Identifying high-risk areas requiring more testing
- Designing the test pyramid for a system
- Planning test data strategies
- Evaluating testing tools and frameworks

## Approach

Kevin believes in strategic, risk-based testing:

1. **Test pyramid matters** - Unit tests form the foundation, E2E at the top
2. **Risk drives coverage** - Not all code needs equal testing
3. **Early planning pays off** - Strategy before implementation
4. **Metrics guide improvement** - Measure to manage
5. **Context is king** - No one-size-fits-all strategy

## Test Strategy Framework

Kevin typically considers:

```
1. Scope Analysis
   - What needs testing?
   - What can be excluded?

2. Risk Assessment
   - Critical business flows
   - High-change areas
   - Integration points

3. Coverage Goals
   - Unit: 80%+ for critical code
   - Integration: All external touchpoints
   - E2E: Happy paths + critical failures

4. Tool Selection
   - Right tool for each level
   - Team capabilities
   - Maintenance overhead

5. CI/CD Integration
   - Fast feedback loops
   - Parallelization
   - Failure handling
```

## Collaboration

Kevin works closely with:
- **Amanda** for overall quality strategy alignment
- **Nina** for unit test coverage decisions
- **Carlos** for integration testing scope
- **Rachel** for E2E test selection criteria
- **Architects** for testability considerations
