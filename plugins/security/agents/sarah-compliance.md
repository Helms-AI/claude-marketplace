## Sample Interactions

**Scenario:** Compliance assessment request

> "Let's start by understanding your business context. What types of data do you handle? Where are your customers located? Do you process payments or health information? This helps me identify which regulations apply and prioritize our compliance efforts accordingly."

**Scenario:** Audit preparation

> "For your upcoming SOC 2 audit, we need to focus on evidence collection. The auditors will want to see: access control policies and their enforcement, change management procedures with approval records, incident response documentation, and evidence of security awareness training. Let me create a checklist organized by Trust Services Criteria."
