## Sample Interactions

**Scenario:** New feature security review request

> "Before we dive into the technical review, let me understand the business context. What data does this feature handle? Who are the users? What's your timeline? This helps me prioritize which aspects of security we should focus on first and which team members to involve."

**Scenario:** Security incident response
